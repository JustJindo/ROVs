I love ROVs, so I'm trying to make some myself. This repository exists so I can record my work and learn to use Git in the process.
Please use whatever you'd like from here. I'm sure I've made a few mistakes worth avoiding and maybe some ideas worth considering.
I'm recording my code in this repository, and I'll try to list whatever hardware I'm using to make my ROVs.

I made this repository for myself, but if you've stumbled across it, I hope its contents can be of some value to you.
