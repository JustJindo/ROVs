I love ROVs, so I'm trying to make some myself. This repository exists so I can record my work and learn to use Git in the process.
If you're also interested in building ROVs, please use whatever you'd like from here. I'm sure I've accumulated a few mistakes worth avoiding and maybe some ideas worth considering.
I'm recording my code in this repository, and I'll try to list whatever hardware I'm using to make my ROVs.
Make something cool (and spend less money than I did in the process ;_;)!
I made this repository for myself, but if you've somehow stumbled across it, I hope its contents can be of some value to you.
